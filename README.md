# FastEvent
FastEvent is an event management application that I am currently building. A prototype can be viewed at:
http://fastevent.herokuapp.com

This application allows an administrator to create a public event page using an embedded text editor. The public page also shows the meta-data associated with the event, a Google Map showing the event location, and a weather widget that displays the weather for the event location. An important feature that I have not yet implemented will allow visitors to the public page to opt in to receive text message updates when event details or schedules change. The administrator of the public page will have the option to set up text messaging, and he/she will be able to send the updates from their own mobile phone. 

This application is built using Node.js, React and Redux. It is isomorphic/universal in that React can render any page on the server. I have created this repository in order to make available some of the source code for those who might be interested.
